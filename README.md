# BACKGROUND

# OBJECTIVE

This study aims to leverage the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network trained on the ImageNet database to perform image classification in the healthy and metastasis classes.

# WORKFLOW

Selected a balanced subset of 2000 images from each class for training, with a 50:50 distribution.
Pre-processed (normalized) images were then input into the VGG16 network.
We developed an API using FastAPI and deployed the model as a web app using Streamlit.

# APPLICATION

Streamlit:
Our Streamlit app is a user-friendly platform designed for histopathologic cancer detection. We've tailored it to enable users to upload histopathologic images in
specifically in 'tif' or 'tiff' file formats and receive accurate predictions regarding the presence of cancer. The app is enhanced with HTML styling for better visual appeal and offers an intuitive interface for ease of use. Key features of our app include:

Image Analysis and Prediction: Users can request a prediction u
